## About
This is my repo for storing custom `.bashrc` files for use on my Linux systems. It includes a set of aliases for compatibility with some of the command line tools I like and adds some visual flare to my terminal.


## Installation
Move your config of choice to `~/.bashrc` and either `source ~/.bashrc` or restart your terminal emulator. For this to work you will need the following:
- `bat`/`batcat`
- `zoxide`
- `fzf`
- `eza`
- `git`

Optionally install [Starship](https://starship.rs/) if you'd like to use the Nordic theme. If you do this, move `starship.toml` to `~/.config/`.


## Credits
Thanks to the couple people on the StyroPyro Discord server that helped me figure out how to do this! Secondarily, `starship.toml` is borrowed from Chris Titus' [Beautiful Bash](https://github.com/christitustech/mybash).
